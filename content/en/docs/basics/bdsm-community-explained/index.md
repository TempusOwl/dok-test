## The Community

BDSM is a community first and foremost, with its own expectations, rules & limits that we entrust with each other. It is far more meaningful than a tag in PornHub, admittedly long ago this was my view about BDSM until I met someone who taught me there is so much more to BDSM. The BDSM Community has an intense focus on promoting and ensuring safety with each other. Often local gatherings, sites, and online communities like ours exist to promote a safer exploration into BDSM for others, as well as a way to meet others safely. If you ever sought out your local community, you will see a wide array of rules and expectations to participate in events. Local gatherings often work through vouches and other means to foster a safe and discrete community. Alternatively, there are many great public events you can join through fetlife.com that can open more doors to private gatherings through the connections you make along the way in the community.

## How does policing work?

We all do our small part to keep the community a better place. We all help one another learn, give resources and fix incorrect information. When you see someone being unsafe, do not be afraid to speak up. If your friend is having an unhealthy dynamic, let them know. BDSM is unfortunately an intimate topic so bad stuff can easily go unchecked/unnoticed in private, so if you are in a position to help do your part respectfully. Though, if you are part of our Discord let our Staff know if things escalate, so we can take care and mod-action the users.

In local events like dungeons, there are people called Dungeons Monitors. These people take the form of a staff figure who moderates events and ensures everyone is safe when being kinky. If they see unsafe behaviors, or if rules are being broken (such as drug use) they stop your scene and may kick you out depending. Rules can vary from place, safety is important and many have strict no substance rules, even alcohol. Dungeon Monitors typically take their role quite seriously, if something were to happen it is their responsibility. If they tell you to stop, you stop. Their authority is absolute, and it's not to be questioned even if you disagree, their house, their rules. Small mistakes happen and if you screw up something you listen and learn. Dungeon Monitors usually have significant experience and are a good way to ask about rules, kink safety, or protocol if you are unsure about something new to you. Dungeon Masters are the last role you may find in your local community. It denotes the person who owns or manages the event, usually in charge of the Dungeon Monitors (maybe one themselves in practice too).

## To Be In A Dynamic

BDSM dynamics are something precious, and they are to be taken seriously. If you're a serial abuser, cheater, or overall shitty person, expect to be ostracized by those in your local community, or in communities like ours. Therefore, always follow rules, put your best foot forward and raise others up by educating them, so we are all rise together as a BDSM community.

## How can I tell who is in the community?

In the last decade, BDSM has become mainstream. This has made it hard to tell if a person's interests in BDSM is superficial and inspired by porn/movies, or if they are serious about diving into BDSM. You will come across people who lack understanding of what BDSM is (especially people under 30). These types of people fall into a gray area where they say they are into BDSM because it's trendy and attractive, but do not involve themselves in the any BDSM communities or try to educate themselves. Usually meaning they do not see themselves part of the community, see BDSM purely as a simple sexual kink and misunderstanding it entirelly.

Forming dynamics with people like these is not a dealbreaker, but helping a person explore is a serious commitment. BDSM is something that takes years for people to learn about what they really want, if not decades. That someone, may find their path does not align with your path. It's not uncommon for things to fall apart with so much uncertainty. In the same vein, it can be rewarding seeing the growth of a partner. Personally, I recommend staying away from these dynamics unless you like helping/teaching, or you are likely to get frustrated.

Ideal place to find partners interested in BDSM is in communties like ours or local gather events (like found on fetlife.com). Lastly, places like reddit have hyper-focused communities for every kink you could imagine.

## The most important factor

The sign someone respects BDSM (and potentially you) is if they sought to educate themselves about BDSM and safety for the kinks they enjoy. Many say they are into BDSM and are unable to answer basic safety concepts or questions about BDSM, or what their kinks mean to them. Sometimes playing the "I know it all card" or otherwise hyping up their superficial knowledge and disregarding criticism. If someone has sought out BDSM education, they are likely involved in the community and that is a great sign they are serious.
