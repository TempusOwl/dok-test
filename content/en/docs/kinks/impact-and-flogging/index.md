This section is a draft, expect errors and issues.

## Important Safety Concepts

- Bad Zones – Not all areas on the body should be hit, hitting the wrong areas can cause real bodily damage to your partner. Even when you are safe, there is always a risk. Having safe words and communication are important. Zones alone should not be a rule, but a tool in addition to your partner’s comfortability. Below is a shortlist of dangerous zones and WHY they are dangerous.
- Tailbone is low down below the spine and is quite vulnerable to being hit during a scene near the butt. It is incredibly sensitive and can bruise causing longer-term recovery. In severe cases, it can break due to its exposed nature and require hospitalization.
- Spine is vulnerable to impact and damage to it and its disk can range from light bruising and discomfort to permanent nerve damage. The spine must be avoided in its entirety from being impacted for safety. Consider using a buffer of space as not to hit the spine by accident during a scene.
- Ears are incredibly dangerous the impact of a paddle or hand on the side of the head/ears can create permanent hearing loss. Ruptured eardrums due to the air pressure of a paddle/hand have the same effect as a gunshot or explosion and have the potential to cause hearing loss.
- Neck has discs that come from your spine as well as carriers signals from the brain to the rest of the body. The neck is quite fragile to being hit and should never bit hit during a scene. In addition, it contains the throat and other arteries you do not want to harm. The front, back, and sides of the neck are always off-limits for safety.
- Joints are a no-go, anything like the hips, hands, and knees are unsafe. Impacting these areas inflicts harm and can cause intense bruising and can even damage or potentially dislocate them. Areas with more fat/muscle are safer for impact play and carry far less risk.
- Face, while face slapping is common there is serious precautions you should take. Hard impacts to the face can cause whiplash or brain/neck trauma. Use your hand and make it easier, choosing not to use the equipment on the face/head that may hit harder than you anticipate. Consider bracing your partner’s head with one hand and slapping with another to lessen the movement of their head and neck for safety if you plan to hit harder. As a general rule be lighter with face impact as the area has eyes, nose, ears etc… that are danger zones. Never hit near the ears (IE: Side Of Head) of someone, the pressure wave of hand or paddle can cause severe pain and even hearing loss.

### Bruising & Marks

- Not everyone bruises, in the same way, some bruise incredibly easy while others do not bruise, do not push people/yourself over the edge to achieve a goal of bruising. Each human’s body acts differently and that is totally okay.
- Be mindful of where you hit, bruises can occur, and making sure they are not visible or can be hidden is good practice unless previously discussed.
- Visibility - Bruising can be visible after and can cause “questions” if others see them. Be mindful of a person likely to bruise, where you hit them.

### Good Beginner Zones

- Butt – Area in the middle as well as lower down near the thigh is considered safe while anything higher near the top of the butt towards the back is considered unsafe. The tailbone right above the butt is quite vulnerable to being hit. Always keep your paddle in the middle of the butt or lower for safety.

## Paddles

### Styles & Terms

- Paddles Without Holes – They hit harder than a hand, but the air cushion of the flat surface hitting deadens the blow on the skin.
- Paddles With Holes – They hit much harder as they lack air cushion and the contact on the skin is more instant. (Not recommended for the first time)
- Slappers – These are paddles but in two pieces. Upon impact, the added plate slaps back onto the one in contact with the skin creating an extra effect on the individual.

### Size

The larger the paddle the less pain it will give (within reason of course), this is due to the air cushion combined with its lesser ability to go through the air. This is important as people think smaller means better for beginners. Smaller paddles move through the air far faster, have less air to displace on contact so overall they hit far harder causing more pain. Consider starting out with larger surface area paddles rather than small ones or try an assortment.

### Weight

The heavier an impact toy is the more pain it will inflict. Starting light is good practice with new partners until you learn their pain threshold.

### Materials

- Leather w/ cardboard or soft plastic core
- Faux Leather is a popular style found in sex stores and a good beginner one if you are unsure it is your thing yet. The pain level is moderate depending on the rigidity and weight. Real leather can be found in more rigid styles that will inflict more pain. Real Leather does require more attention to care for and clean which you should take into consideration.
- Hard Plastics (like perspex), Reinforced Fiberglass, Vinyl Have a harsh impact and are considered medium-high in pain. They are easy to clean which is a big plus and requires little maintenance.
- Wood Have a harsh impact due to their extra weight. If you consider buying handmade or make your own make sure it is heavily sanded, vanished, and protected to prevent splinters. Wood also requires upkeep and handwashing among many other things to keep it sanitary and its fibers healthy.
- Metals Are uncommon due to their larger cost, prone to bending and larger weight. Cheap metal can also rust/oxidize requiring it to be through away or replaced. Solid quality metal safe for the body is usually not easy to find. Additionally, some have metal allergies making these paddles absolute no-go’s. Plastics or leathers are more ideal in my opinion.

### NEVER USE These Materials

- Glass while clear and transparent, its rigidity makes it a poor choice for impact play. It's too likely to break rather than bend.
- Cheap unlisted plastics formulas as these can injure your partner during impact play. Always look at reviews for quality assurance and see what it is made of.
